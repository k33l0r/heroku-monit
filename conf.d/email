## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be 
## specified using a comma separator. If the first mail server fails, Monit 
# will use the second mail server in the list and so on. By default Monit uses 
# port 25 - it is possible to override this with the PORT option.
set mailserver smtp.mandrillapp.com port 587
  username "${MANDRILL_USERNAME}" password "${MANDRILL_APIKEY}"
  using SSLAUTO, with timeout 30 seconds using hostname heroku.com

## You can set alert recipients whom will receive alerts if/when a 
## service defined in this file has errors. Alerts may be restricted on 
## events by using a filter as in the second example below. 
#
set alert ${NOTIFY_EMAIL}                       # receive all alerts
# set alert ${NOTIFY_EMAIL} only on { timeout }
